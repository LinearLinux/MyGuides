/* ---- like operator (similar to includes) ----

SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <column> LIKE '%<search criteria>%';

                using "like", the % key acts as a wildcard like * in most other things

                similarly the _ uses a fill in the blank so '_r%' would return any entry that has the second letter of "r"

                to have anything that has at least characters us 'a_%_%'

                AND/OR operators work between like statements I.E.- where [name] like '%Panel%' AND logcode_id like '%GET%';
